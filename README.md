# Senior Design Project Summary

## Project Overview

For my senior design project, I worked with one other person to create a **handheld electrochemical diagnostics device**. The project consisted of two major components:

1. A **printed circuit board (PCB)** with high-voltage drivers used to control liquid movement
2. A **glass chip** used for electrochemical diagnostics

## Glass Chip Fabrication

The glass chip was created using a process called **photolithography**. Photolithography involves printing a pattern onto a material using a photosensitive layer, followed by metal evaporation onto the chip. Any excess metal is then washed away.

This fabrication process required **over nine months** to develop a fully functional chip.

### Glass Chip Composition
- Chromium
- Silver
- SU-8
- ITO Glass
- Two layers of double-sided tape

## PCB Design and Control System

The PCB was designed and produced alongside the glass chip. It was built around an **Arduino-based system**.

A **high-voltage driver circuit** was integrated into the PCB and controlled via an **SPI communication line** connected directly to the Arduino.

## Closing Statement

This document provides a brief overview of the project. I would be happy to discuss the project further over the phone or via email.
